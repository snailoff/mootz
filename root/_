The metadata encoded using the syntax described by MultiMarkdown can be optionally extracted from the document.

The md-to-html function will attempt to parse the metadata when passed the :parse-meta? true option and return it as its output. Additionally, md-to-html-string-with-meta function can be used to parse string input. The function returns a map with two keys, :html containing the parsed HTML, and :metadata containing a map with the metadata included at the top of the document.

The value of each key in the metadata map will be a list of either 0, 1 or many strings. If a metadata value ends in two spaces then the string will end in a newline. If a line does not contain a header and has at least 4 spaces in front of it then it will be considered to be a member of the last key that was found.
